# :cloud: Mawingu-Dev
> :bulb: Devstack Project
## üí¨ Description
> This are the steps to follow to deploy a django application on a devstack instance. I have installed devstack on a virtual machine and through horizon I will create an instance and clone a django application on that instance and run it.

# :briefcase: Resources
> Links to the youtube videos and documentation i have used to achieve this.

## üìú More
 1. ### Virtual Machine or Instance
 - Virtualization or simulation of a computer system.
     > For this project I am using an virtual machine that's running on ubuntu Os.
      
 2. ### Devstack
 - An development open-source cloud platform running as IaaS model that allows you to manage and create resources such as computation, networks etc. In other words the "minikube" to openstack. 
     > I installed devstack on my machine using the stable/xena branch.
 3. ### Django App
 - A python framework that allows you to create web application and more.
     > In this project I am going to clone a simple django project of mine that just displays a static page.
     
 4. ### Nginx and G-Unicorn
 - Nginx will serve as a server proxy while G-unicorn will implement a WSGI server.
     > This will allow me to serve my application to a web browser.
## üîß Steps
- I am considering you have installed and deployed devstack on your virtual machine and have managed to open up horizon on your web browser.
	> If you want to follow the CLI codes you can use link. ![CLI STEPS](https://docs.openstack.org/networking-ovn/latest/contributor/testing.html)
	1. Create a new project.
     		> A project is a logical grouping of resources in a devstack environment that are isolated from other users and groups.
     		> On horizon, on the left side bar navigate to Identity -> Projects -> Create New Project
	1. Create a new user.
     		> This will be an entity that will allow you to interact with the resources in devstack through your created project
     		> On horizon, on the left side bar navigate to Identity -> Users -> Create New User
     		> Choose member as the role and link the user to your created project.
     		> Sign out as the admin and log in as the new user with the credentials made.
	1. Create a new network.
     		> A network isolation for instances and resources in a project.
     		> On horizon, on the left side bar navigate to Project -> Network -> Networks -> Create New Network
     		> Add the name, subnet name , set IP address (I used 192.168.0/24) and create.
	1. Create a Router.
     		> A router will allow transfer of data through networks by reading IP Addresses.
     		> On horizon, on the left side bar navigate to Project -> Network -> Routers -> Create New
     		> Add an interface to the created router to link the external network to the private network created.
	1. Create a Security Group.
     		> A security group is a virtual firewall that controls ingress and egress traffic to your instance.
     		> On horizon, on the left sidebar click on Network -> Security Groups -> Create New
     		> Add a new rule in the Security group to allow SSH traffic from your hardware node.
	1. Generate SSH key
		> The key will be used to log in into an instance.

		```bash
  			ssh-keygen -b 4096
		```

	1. Create an Instance.
		This will be a virtual machine instance associated with its networks, security group etc.
			> On horizon, on the left sidebar click on Compute -> Instance -> Create New
			> Create new instance with predefined specs called flavors (I used the m1.small)  and with a downloaded images ( i used the ubuntu image). ![Click here to select images to download](https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html)
			> Once downloaded you can add it through the images bar and select it during instance creation
    
	1. Create an Floating IP.
			> This will allow accessibility of the instance with outside network, this will allow accessing the instance over SSH. 
			> On horizon, on the left sidebar click on Network -> Floating IP -> Create New
			> Set the pool to the external network and associate it with the instance created.

	1. Login to instance with SSH.
     			> Access the instance with the floating IP created and private SSH key generated.
        ```bash
        	ssh -i <path/to/ssh/private_key/> <username@ip_address>
    	```	
    1. Check DNS settings.
     			> Ensure your nameserver is set to 8.8.8.8.
        ```bash
        	vim /etc/resolv.conf
    	```
	1. Download nginx.
     			> Download the server proxy we will use for running our django application.
        ```bash
        	sudo apt-get install nginx
    	```
	1. Download python and its environment package.
     			> The django application requires a python environment for running and installing packages.
        ```bash
        	sudo apt install python3
            sudo apt install python3-pip
            pip install virtualenv
    	```
	1. Create new environment.
     			> In this step I create an environment called base..
        ```bash
        	python3 -m virtualenv base
            source base/bin/activate
    	```
	1. Clone repo with the django project.
     			> Clone the repo from github to run on the server.
        ```bash
        	git clone https://github.com/devoure/mawingu-dev.git
    	```
	1. Install the dependencies.
     			> Move to the root of the project and install dependencies will be.
        ```bash
        	cd mawingu-dev/app/
            pip install -r requirements.txt
    	```
	1. Add gunicorn configs
     			> Add configs used by guncicorn at the base of the repository
        ```bash
            mkdir configs/
            vim gunicorn_confs.py
    	```

        ```python
            command='\home\ubuntu\path\to\gunicorn\executable'
            pythonpath='\home\ubuntu\<path\to\django\app>'
            bind='ip_address:8000'
            workers=3
        ```
	1. Add nginx configs
     			> create a file with nginx configs
        ```bash
            sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/mawingu
    	```

        ```
            server{
                listen 80;
                server_name <ip_adress>;

                location /static/ {
                    root /home/ubuntu/<path/to/your/static/files>;

                }
                location / {
                    proxy_pass http://<ip_address>:8000;
                }

            }
        ```
            
    	1. Link the file created with default file in sites-enabled.
     			> Link the nginx conf file with the default.
        ```bash
        	cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
            sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mawingu
    	```
